The Database Blueprint
The database is split into different tables for one simple reason: to avoid a messy spreadsheet. Instead of one giant table where you re-type "Dr. John Smith" or "Paracetamol" over and over, you store them once and just link to them.

Here's how the "folders" are organized:

1. The "Dictionary" Tables (Lookup Tables)
These are tiny tables that just hold standard options, like the choices in a dropdown menu. This is a neat trick to keep the data clean. Instead of letting people type "Suspect" or "suspect," you make them pick "Role #1" from a list.

Lookup_Seriousness: Holds the options like 'SERIOUS' or 'NON-SERIOUS'.

Lookup_Outcome: Holds 'RECOVERED', 'FATAL', 'UNKNOWN', etc.

Lookup_Drug_Role: Stores whether a drug was the 'SUSPECT', 'CONCOMITANT' (taken at the same time), or 'INTERACTING'.

Lookup_Route: Lists how the drug was taken ('Oral', 'Intravenous', etc.).

2. The "Who" and "What" Tables (Core Tables)
These tables store the main subjectsâ€”the people and things involved.

Reporters: A list of the people (doctors, patients) who reported the problem.

Patients: A list of the patients who experienced the problem.

drugs: A master list (or catalog) of all the drugs.

Reactions: A master list of all the possible side effects ('Nausea', 'Headache').

3. The "Main Event" & "Connector" Tables
This is where everything comes together.

reports: This is the heart of the whole operation. Each row is one unique side effect report. It doesn't store the patient's name; it just stores their patient_id (linking to the Patients table). It does the same for the reporter, the seriousness, and the outcome.

report_drugs & report_reactions: These are the "glue." A single report might involve three drugs (one suspect, two others) and two side effects (like nausea and a headache). These tables link that one report to all the different drugs and reactions associated with it.

What the Script Does
CREATE TABLE ...: All the lines starting with CREATE TABLE are just building this empty structure. It's like creating all the empty folders and defining what kind of information can go in them.

INSERT INTO ...: All the lines starting with INSERT INTO are the final step. This is where the script populates the database with 10 sample patients, 10 drugs, a few reporters, and 10 sample side-effect reports to bring it all to life.

That's it! The script builds the structure and then fills it with data so it's ready to be used.
